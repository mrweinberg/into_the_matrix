        "subject": "The Logos (Captain Niobe’s ship) has a distinct design that sets it apart from the more famous Nebuchadnezzar. While the Nebuchadnezzar is long, skeletal, and vaguely resembles a deep-sea predator, the Logos is compact, stout, and heavily armored. Here is a visual breakdown: Silhouette: It is much shorter and wider than standard hovercraft. It has a squat, beetle-like or horseshoe crab shape. It lacks the long, protruding tail section found on other ships, giving it a dense, bulldog-like appearance. Hull Plating: The exterior is a dark, gunmetal grey with a heavy industrial finish. It looks significantly more solid and encased than other ships, with fewer exposed skeletal gaps. The plating is curved and aerodynamic, suggesting its role as the fleet's fastest and most maneuverable vessel. Propulsion (The Hover Pads): This is its most defining feature. Instead of the Nebuchadnezzar's many smaller pads, the Logos relies on fewer, larger, and very prominent electromagnetic hover discs mounted on thick, articulated struts. When active, these generate the signature crackling blue lightning. Cockpit: The cockpit is integrated smoothly into the front of the main fuselage rather than jutting out on a long neck. It has a sloping, armored front profile. Texture: Like all ships in the Real World, it is covered in a complex layer of conduits, pipes, and cables, but the Logos wears them more tightly against its hull, reinforcing the compact tank aesthetic.In summary: If the Nebuchadnezzar is a jagged spear, the Logos is a polished, heavy stone. It looks built for tight squeezes and high-speed maneuvers in the Mechanical Lines."
